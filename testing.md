## Testing User Stories

### User Stories 

*Applies to site users with and/or without account:*

1. As a site user I can see a list of recipes so that I can choose which one to view.
    * The list of recipes on the home page has been paginated by six. If there are more than six recipes, the remainder moves to the next page. This will continue until there are six or less recipe cards on the one page. The recipe cards show a preview of the recipe to give the user an overview of each recipe. 
2. As a site user I can click on a recipe so that I can view it in full.
    * When a site user clicks a recipe card, the recipe will be displayed in full. The user can now see full ingredients list, instructions and cooking time among other things. 
3. As a site user I can register an account so that I can have access to the site.
    * Any site user that wishes to interact with the page can easily create an account. There are links to register an account in both the navigation bar at the top of the page and in the middle of the home page. If the user tries to access a page or a function that requires Login there are links as well. 
4. As a site user I can like or unlike a recipe so that I can interact with the content.
    * All logged in site users can like or unlike recipes that they find more interesting, thereby helping others see which recipes are more popular. The number of likes is automatically incremented and the change is visible both on the recipe page and the recipe card on the home page.
5. As a site user I can comment recipes so that I can be part of the conversation.
    * All logged in site users can comment their own or other users recipes.
6. As a site user I can delete comments that I have made.
    * All logged in site users can delete their own comments. Below their own comments is a "Delete comment" button displayed. If pushed that specific comment will be deleted.
7. As a site user I can view the comments for a recipe so that I can see read the conversation.
    * Any site user can view the comments made by other users and thereby follow any conversation. 
8. As a site user I can view number of likes for a specifik recipe so that I can see which recipes are more popular.
    * Any site user can view number of likes for each recipe. Number of likes are displayed both in the recipe overview and if a recipe is viewed in detail. 
9. As I site user I can read about the site to understand the benefits of plantbased food and be encouraged to visit the site again.
    * Any site user can visit the About page to read a little more about the page and the benefits of Vegan food. 
10. As a site user I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my content.

11. As a site user I can log in/out so that I can interact with the site.
    * All users with an account can log in and out of the page. The navigation bar at the top will show either Login or Logout depending on whether the user is logged in or not. On the Home page the user will also be greeted by name if logged in. Ta make it even more user friendly an alert will pop ut when the user either logs in or out.
