## Testing User Stories

### User Stories 

*Applies to site users with and/or without account:*

1. As a site user I can see a list of recipes so that I can choose which one to view.
    * The list of recipes on the home page has been paginated by six. If there are more than six recipes, the remainder moves to the next page. This will continue until there are six or less recipe cards on the one page. The recipe cards show a preview of the recipe to give the user an overview of each recipe. 
2. As a site user I can click on a recipe so that I can view it in full.
    * When a site user clicks a recipe card, the recipe will be displayed in full. The user can now see full ingredients list, instructions and cooking time among other things. 
3. As a site user I can register an account so that I can have access to the site.
    * Any site user that wishes to interact with the page can easily create an account. There are links to register an account in both the navigation bar at the top of the page and in the middle of the home page. If the user tries to access a page or a function that requires Login there are links as well. 
4. As a site user I can like or unlike a recipe so that I can interact with the content.
