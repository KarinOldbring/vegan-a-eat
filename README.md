## **Introduction**

**Planning Stage**
When initializing this project I started off by deciding what features should be included to have a good idea of what kind of site I was making. The next step was to create wireframes to start thinking about the design of the site. After that I started working on the database models. I spent quite a lot of time planning and scetching out the project, before writing any code, something that I belive to have benefitted from. 

**Project Goals**
My goal for this site is to create a user friendly site for people who want to enjoy vegan food. The idea is that people can visit the site to get inspiration, and inspire other people! By creating a user account site users can interact by sharing recipes, commenting other recipes and like recipes.

* Connect people who are interested in vegan food. 
* Inspire more people to eat healthy food.
