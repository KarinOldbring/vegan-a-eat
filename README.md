## **Introduction**

**Planning Stage**

When initializing this project I started off by deciding what features should be included to have a good idea of what kind of site I was making. The next step was to create wireframes to start thinking about the design of the site. After that I started working on the database models. I decided to start with the backend first, to get those part up and running and then focusing on the design. I spent quite a lot of time planning and scetching out the project, before writing any code, something that I belive to have benefitted from. 

**Project Goals**

My goal for this site is to create a user friendly site for people who want to enjoy vegan food. The idea is that people can visit the site to get inspiration, and inspire other people! By creating a user account site users can interact by sharing recipes, commenting other recipes and like recipes.

* Clean and sophisticated design to enhance user experience.

* The style aims to give the user such a good experience that they will want to visit the site again. 

**Design Choices**

* Font

As Font I chose Playfair Display for all my headings for its playful but yet stylish design. To keep the site neat I chose to use Lato for all other text on the site. 
font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

* Color Scheme

Since the site displays images of different vegan recipes it was important to me to keep the site clean and not take focus from the food. Hence I chose not to add lots of different colors on the site, and the colors that are present should blend in well with the theme. The nav-bar and footer have a very light green that goes well with the darker green of the logo. The orange color of the carrot in the logo is used when hovering recipes. 
Besides these colors I chose to keep the background color white and the text black. 

- Light green: #e0e7cd
- Dark green: #1f451a
- Orange: #f4900c
- White: #ffffff
- Black: #000000

* Logo Vegan-a-eat

I used [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) to create my logo. I wanted a clean logo that goes well with the content of the site.

* Images

The images on the site are chosen to go well with what ever images users upload. To keep consistency I have chosen to display images wiht mostly green palettes.
